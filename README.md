### Welcome to my GitHub profile ğŸš€

I am a student at Concordia's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. ğŸ¤“

I like working on the front-end of websites ğŸ’… just as much as I like working on the back-end ğŸ¦¾.

Before finding my passion for software engineering, I was an audio engineer ğŸ”Š. I find there are many similarities but programming is where lies ğŸ’–.
